def hairpin_counter(sequence, min_stem=3, min_loop=4, max_loop=9):
    """
    Counts the number of potential hairpin structures in a DNA sequence. Hairpins are common secondary structures
    in nucleic acids where a sequence of nucleotides can fold back on itself to form a double-stranded stem with a single-stranded loop.

    The algorithm searches for regions within the sequence where a segment can base-pair with its reverse complement separated by a loop.
    This function scans for such occurrences by examining every possible substring as a potential stem and ensuring the intervening
    sequence, which would form the loop, meets the specified length requirements.

    Parameters:
        sequence (str): The DNA sequence to analyze.
        min_stem (int): Minimum number of bases in the stem for stable hairpin. The stem must be able to form at least this many
                        complementary base pairs to be considered.
        min_loop (int): Minimum number of bases in the loop. This prevents the formation of overly tight hairpins which may not be biologically relevant.
        max_loop (int): Maximum number of bases in the loop. This constrains the loop to a realistic size, preventing unlikely structures.

    Returns:
        int: The count of potential hairpin structures detected, indicating regions where secondary structure formation might inhibit biological processes like transcription or translation.

    This method does not account for the thermodynamic stability of the predicted hairpins, focusing solely on their potential for formation based on sequence complementarity and specified geometrical constraints.
